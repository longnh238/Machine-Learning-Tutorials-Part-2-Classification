# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 2: Classification

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 2: Classification**, the second part of our beginner-friendly guide to machine learning. In this part, we focus on popular classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This tutorial series provides hands-on coding exercises using Python, Scikit-learn, and other essential libraries, enabling you to master these classification techniques.

## Introduction
In this second part, we dive into the following topics:
- Decision Trees: How to classify data based on decision rules
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifying data based on proximity to neighbors
- Naive Bayes: Using probability for classification
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Separating data using hyperplanes

Each algorithm will be explained with theoretical concepts and practical implementation using Python.

## Installation
To run the tutorials, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## Tutorial Topics
1. **Decision Trees**
   - How Decision Trees work
   - Building and visualizing Decision Trees in Python
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Distance-based classification
   - Implementing KNN in Python
3. **Naive Bayes**
   - Basics of probability theory
   - Applying Naive Bayes to classification problems
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
